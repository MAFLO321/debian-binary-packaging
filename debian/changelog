zrepl (0.3.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  Please check https://zrepl.github.io/v0.3.0/changelog.html for a full list of changes.

  ## Highlights
  
  * **Resumable Send & Recv Support** No knobs required, automatically used where supported.
  * **Encrypted Send & Recv Support** for OpenZFS native encryption, configurable at the
    job level, i.e., for all filesystems a job is responsible for.
  * **Replication Guarantees** Automatic use of ZFS holds and bookmarks to protect a replicated
    filesystem from losing synchronization between sender and receiver. By default, zrepl
    guarantees that incremental replication will always be possible and interrupted steps
    will always be resumable.
  
  We highly recommend studying the overview section of the configuration chapter
    https://zrepl.github.io/v0.3.0/configuration/overview.html
  to understand how zrepl replication works.
